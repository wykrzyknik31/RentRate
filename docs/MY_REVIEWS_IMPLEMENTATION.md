# My Reviews Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the "My Reviews" feature for the RentRate application, which allows users to view, edit, and delete their own property reviews.

## Issue Requirements Met

### Database Schema ✅
- [x] Added `user_id` column (INTEGER) to review table
- [x] Added foreign key constraint: `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
- [x] Added index: `CREATE INDEX idx_review_user_id ON review(user_id)`

### Backend API ✅
- [x] Reviews automatically linked to logged-in user when created
- [x] New endpoint `/api/my-reviews` returns only user's reviews
- [x] PUT `/api/reviews/<id>` endpoint for editing own reviews
- [x] DELETE `/api/reviews/<id>` endpoint for deleting own reviews
- [x] Authentication middleware identifies logged-in user
- [x] Ownership validation prevents editing/deleting others' reviews

### Frontend ✅
- [x] "My Reviews" page at `/my-reviews`
- [x] Link in navigation bar (visible when logged in)
- [x] Displays only logged-in user's reviews
- [x] Edit functionality with modal dialog
- [x] Delete functionality with confirmation
- [x] Sorted by most recent first

## Key Implementation Details

### Database Changes

**Review Model** (`backend/app.py` lines 75-102):
```python
class Review(db.Model):
    # ... other fields ...
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id', ondelete='CASCADE'), nullable=True)
    
    # Index for performance
    __table_args__ = (
        db.Index('idx_review_user_id', 'user_id'),
    )
```

**SQLite Foreign Key Support** (`backend/app.py` lines 57-67):
```python
@event.listens_for(Engine, "connect")
def set_sqlite_pragma(dbapi_conn, connection_record):
    """Enable foreign key constraints for SQLite"""
    if 'sqlite' in str(dbapi_conn):
        cursor = dbapi_conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON")
        cursor.close()
```

### API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/my-reviews`
- **Authentication**: Required
- **Returns**: Array of reviews belonging to the logged-in user
- **Sorting**: Most recent first
- **Implementation**: Lines 523-528 in `backend/app.py`

#### PUT `/api/reviews/<id>`
- **Authentication**: Required
- **Authorization**: User must own the review
- **Updateable Fields**: rating, review_text, landlord_name, landlord_rating, city
- **Implementation**: Lines 530-569 in `backend/app.py`

#### DELETE `/api/reviews/<id>`
- **Authentication**: Required
- **Authorization**: User must own the review
- **Implementation**: Lines 571-585 in `backend/app.py`

#### POST `/api/reviews`
- **Authentication**: Optional
- **Auto-sets user_id**: If user is logged in, automatically links review
- **Anonymous Support**: If not logged in, user_id is NULL
- **Implementation**: Lines 402-513 in `backend/app.py`

### Frontend Components

**My Reviews Page** (`frontend/app/my-reviews/page.tsx`):
- Fetches user's reviews from `/api/my-reviews`
- Displays reviews with property information
- Edit button opens modal with form
- Delete button with confirmation dialog
- Handles empty state (no reviews yet)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Navigation Integration** (`frontend/app/components/Navbar.tsx`):
- "My Reviews" link visible only when user is logged in
- Link added at line 71-76

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **18 tests** in `tests/test_my_reviews.py`
- **2 tests** in `tests/test_cascade_delete.py`
- **100% pass rate** for all My Reviews features

### Test Scenarios Covered
- ✅ Authentication required for My Reviews endpoints
- ✅ Empty reviews list for new users
- ✅ Filtering reviews by user
- ✅ Sorting by most recent
- ✅ Update permissions (own reviews only)
- ✅ Delete permissions (own reviews only)
- ✅ Invalid rating validation
- ✅ Anonymous review creation
- ✅ Anonymous reviews excluded from My Reviews
- ✅ Foreign key constraint exists
- ✅ Index exists on user_id

## Migration

**Migration Script**: `backend/migrate_add_user_id.py`

### Features
- Supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL
- Detects database type automatically
- Creates index if missing
- Adds ON DELETE CASCADE constraint
- Handles existing data safely

### Usage
```bash
# Local development (SQLite)
python backend/migrate_add_user_id.py

# Docker/Production (PostgreSQL)
docker exec -it rentrate-backend python migrate_add_user_id.py
```

### What It Does
1. Connects to the database
2. Checks if review table exists
3. Checks if index already exists
4. For SQLite: Recreates table with proper constraints
5. For PostgreSQL: Adds index and updates foreign key
6. Preserves all existing data

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures
1. **Authentication Required**: All My Reviews operations require valid JWT token
2. **Ownership Validation**: Users can only edit/delete their own reviews
3. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Database enforces referential integrity
4. **CASCADE DELETE**: User deletion automatically removes their reviews
5. **Anonymous Reviews**: Supported with NULL user_id for non-authenticated submissions

### Security Analysis
- CodeQL analysis performed
- 1 false positive identified (database URI logging - already sanitized)
- No actual security vulnerabilities introduced

## Performance

### Index Benefits
The `idx_review_user_id` index provides:
- Faster filtering of reviews by user
- Improved performance for `/api/my-reviews` endpoint
- Efficient foreign key constraint checking

### Expected Impact
- O(log n) instead of O(n) for user review lookups
- Negligible impact on INSERT operations
- Significant improvement for users with many reviews

## Backwards Compatibility

### Existing Reviews
- Reviews created before this feature have `user_id = NULL`
- They appear in global review lists but not in any user's "My Reviews"
- They cannot be edited or deleted through the API
- This is by design to maintain data integrity

### Database Compatibility
- SQLite: Requires PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON (automatically handled)
- PostgreSQL: Fully supported, no special configuration needed
- Migration script handles both databases

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Bulk edit/delete for multiple reviews
2. Review drafts (save without publishing)
3. Review history/versioning
4. Sharing reviews with other users
5. Review templates for common scenarios

## Files Changed

### Backend
- `backend/app.py` - Model updates, foreign key listener, endpoints exist
- `backend/migrate_add_user_id.py` - New migration script

### Frontend
