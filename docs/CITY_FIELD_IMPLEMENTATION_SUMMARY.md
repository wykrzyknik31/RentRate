# City Field Implementation - Summary

## Problem Statement
The GET /api/reviews endpoint was failing with a 500 Internal Server Error:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: column property.city does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The backend code expected a `city` column in the property table (used in `review.to_dict()`), but:
1. The column existed in the model but was nullable (optional)
2. Existing databases might not have had the column at all
3. The API didn't enforce city as a required field
4. The frontend allowed submitting properties without a city

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (app.py)
- Made `city` field mandatory: `city = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)`
- Added `city` to required fields validation in POST /api/reviews
- Updated property creation to always require and use the city field

### 2. Frontend Changes (add-review/page.tsx)
- Made city input field required with HTML validation
- Added red asterisk (*) visual indicator
- Always send city value in form submissions

### 3. Database Migration (migrate_add_city.py)
- Created automated migration script for existing databases
- Supports both SQLite (local) and PostgreSQL (Docker)
- Adds city column with 'Unknown' as default for existing properties
- Handles NULL values in existing data
- Secure: No password logging

### 4. Testing (test_api.py)
- Updated all 12 existing tests to include city field
- Added 4 new tests for city field validation:
  - `test_post_review_with_city_succeeds`
  - `test_post_review_missing_city_returns_400`
  - `test_post_review_empty_city_returns_400`
  - `test_get_reviews_with_property_includes_city`
- All 16 tests passing ✅

### 5. Documentation (CITY_FIELD_MIGRATION.md)
- Comprehensive migration guide
- Three migration options (automated script, manual SQL, fresh start)
- Troubleshooting section
- API impact documentation

## API Changes

### Before
```json
POST /api/reviews
{
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "property_type": "apartment",
  "rating": 5
}
```

### After
```json
POST /api/reviews
{
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "city": "New York",  // ← Now required!
  "property_type": "apartment",
  "rating": 5
}
```

### Error Response (missing city)
```json
{
  "error": "Missing required field: city"
}
```

## Migration Instructions

### For Existing Deployments

**Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)**
```bash
# Local development (SQLite)
python backend/migrate_add_city.py

# Docker (PostgreSQL)
docker compose exec backend python migrate_add_city.py
```

**Option 2: Fresh Start**
```bash
# Local
rm backend/rentrate.db
python backend/app.py

# Docker
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

## Verification

1. **API Test - Success Case**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/reviews \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "123 Test St", "city": "New York", "property_type": "apartment", "rating": 5}'
```
Expected: 201 Created with property including city

2. **API Test - Error Case**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/reviews \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "123 Test St", "property_type": "apartment", "rating": 5}'
```
Expected: 400 Bad Request with error message about missing city

3. **API Test - GET Reviews**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/reviews
```
Expected: 200 OK with reviews including city in property object

## Test Results
```
16 tests passed, 0 failed
- 2 root endpoint tests
- 14 review endpoint tests (including 4 new city field tests)
```

## Security
- Fixed clear text password logging vulnerability in migration script
- Database credentials are now redacted from log output
- No other security issues introduced

## Files Changed
1. `backend/app.py` - Property model and API validation
2. `frontend/app/add-review/page.tsx` - Form validation
3. `tests/test_api.py` - Updated and new tests
4. `backend/migrate_add_city.py` - New migration script
5. `docs/CITY_FIELD_MIGRATION.md` - New documentation

## Breaking Changes
⚠️ **API Breaking Change**: POST /api/reviews now requires `city` field

## Backward Compatibility
- Migration script provides default value ('Unknown') for existing properties
- No data loss
- Existing reviews remain intact
- Frontend and backend changes are coordinated

## Next Steps for Users
1. Run the migration script before deploying
2. Update any API clients to include city field
3. Test in staging environment before production
4. Monitor logs for any migration issues
5. Update API documentation if you have consumer-facing docs

## Support
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the migration guide: `docs/CITY_FIELD_MIGRATION.md`
2. Verify database connectivity and permissions
3. Review error messages in migration script output
4. Open a GitHub issue with details

## Summary
✅ Issue resolved: GET /api/reviews now works correctly
✅ City field is now mandatory for all properties
✅ Migration path provided for existing databases
✅ All tests passing
✅ Security vulnerabilities fixed
✅ Comprehensive documentation provided
